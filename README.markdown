A site where you can edit and remotely save a gml annotation on a map.

Must have requirements:

* display on top of osm, google and openspaces maps.
* simple controls to edit points, lines and polygons.
    * add all 3
    * move points
    * reshape lines
    * reshape polygons
* save a gml to the server
* permalink to a map + gml annotation.

Nice to have requirements:

* more complex controls to edit points, lines and polygons.
    * move whole lines
    * move whole polygons
    * add vertices to lines
    * add vertices to polygons
    * resize polygons
* a gist like tracking of different versions of the gml annotation
